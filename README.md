Infonet Extract is a scrapper especially made for Infonet.fr, a website allowing to check financial statements and other information of French private companies.

The scrapper is giving you a lot of files but only the "table_1_processed.csv", "merged_table_3_4_final.csv", and "table_2_final.csv" are the right ones.
